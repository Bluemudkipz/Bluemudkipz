    <h1>My name is Noah</h1>
    <p>I am a student at Wake Tech for computer science. I have a lot of animals in my house: 6 cats, 1 dog, an African Grey parrot, a Bearded Dragon, an Arizona Blonde tarantula, a hamster, 8 hermit crabs, and 2 big fish tanks. I like to play League of Legends in my free time; it is my favorite game.</p>
    <p>I enjoy learning html because making websites seems fun.</p>
    <p>My favorite food is pizza and boba.</p>
